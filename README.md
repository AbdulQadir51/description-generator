# Professional README Generator

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

In a command-line program, a user can input data
Upon prompting for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections titled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
README titles are automatically generated based on the project title.
Provide a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. Those sections are described in the README's Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests sections.
There are several options you can choose from when you choose a license for the application. The badge for that license is added to the README near the top, and a notice explaining which license the application is covered by is added to the section of the README entitled License.
Enter your GitHub username. It will then be added to the section entitled Questions, with a link to your GitHub profile. Simply enter your email address. The README section entitled Questions is then updated with instructions on how to reach the user with additional questions. You will be taken to the relevant section of the README by clicking the links in the Table of Contents
